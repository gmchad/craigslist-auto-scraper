This is probably the cleanest and best sorted M5 with higher mileage on the market. I’m sure she’s cleaner and better taken care of then most lower mileage examples. You name it, it most likely was done.\nAll windows work, there’s zero lights or warnings. The carbon build up issue which is very common on the early models is also address NOT masked like other 2000 M5’s. She drives smooth, shifts tight, handles amazing, and has no hiccups.\nThe color makes this car amazing and the handling will put a grin on your face.\n\nI am selling her because I’m ready for a new toy.  I will consider trades. Ideally I’d prefer a trade that is more expensive and I can add cash on top. But not opposed to something cheaper and cash from buyer.  \n\nAsking $25,000",

It’s lowered on what I believe is an adjustable front beam. Interior is just as nice as the exterior. The only small blemish the car has is a little bit of heat bubbling right above the exhaust due to previous exhaust. Only trade I might possibly consider is a Volkswagen single cab.
